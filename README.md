# freact, a simpler react.

As a challenge to myself, I have managed to re-imagine and re-create a new react from scratch. freact allows you to easily build Web UIs using the same react APIs, it is very simple to use, and very powerfull as it has most of react's principle features: Virtual DOM, Statefull Component, etc. (It lacks the Context feature as of now, but I vow to remedy that someday soon.)

Of course freact is never meant to be product-level(though I have so much fun building UIs with it, it runs great with babel), actually the whole purpose of it is to show coders who are still learning, how react really works and how simple its core principles really are, and help them have a complete understanding of react. I sure did writing it.

And it was so much fun for me, that it evolved into a whole plan of creating a brand-new freact family.

So here are some other well-known components that I wrote:
 - a react-router (unfortunately it cannot run with freact because no Context feature).
 - a CSSTransition.
 - a little Expandable Component using my CSSTransition.
 - and an ambitious react-redux, but sadly it's not yet completed, hopefully I will get around to wrap it up after finishing Context.
